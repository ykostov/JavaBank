add money in ATM, import them to an account, withdraw money, exhcnage money and transfer to other user (if created).
+ Currency currently supported: BGN and RSD, live updated via exchangerate.host api

## Used Technology
+ SDK: openjdk-18
+ Java SE 18
+ Maven
+ SQLite 3
## Requirements before powering up

+ TODO (db)

+ As open-source dependencies va Maven are used, powering up the application is highly recomended using a proper Java IDE, for instance - Intellij IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans etc.
